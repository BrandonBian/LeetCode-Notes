## - Miscellaneous Problems with Slow / Fast Pointers

- About **Slow / Fast Pointers for Finding Mid-node of Linked List**: (see LeetCode Problem 234)

```
# initially slow and fast are the same, starting from head
# note that if we set [fast = head.next] INSTEAD, then when while stops, slow will be on LAST node of FIRST half
slow = fast = head

while fast and fast.next:
    # fast traverses faster and moves to the end of the list if the length is odd
    fast = fast.next.next
    slow = slow.next

# when fast reaches the end or past the end, the slow will reach the middle or past the middle
if fast:
    # fast is exactly at the end, move slow one step further for comparison (cross middle one)
    slow = slow.next
    
# now slow should be at the STARTING node of the SECOND half of the list
```

- About **Slow / Fast Pointers for Fiding & Removing N-th Node from End of List**: (see LeetCode 19)

```
fast = slow = head
        
for _ in range(n):
    fast = fast.next # Let fast move n-nodes ahead of slow

# If removing first element of list (n = number of nodes)
if not fast:
    return head.next

# fast and slow will have a distance of n nodes
# so when fast reaches the end node, slow reaches the node before the [n-th node before the end node]
# which is very quite clever

while fast.next:
    fast = fast.next
    slow = slow.next

slow.next = slow.next.next # remove the node after slow

return head # return the modified list
```
