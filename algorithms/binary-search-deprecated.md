- **Conceptually**: Basically, **BINARY SEARCH splits the search space into two halves and only keep the half that probably has the search target and throw away the other half that would not possibly have the answer**. In this manner, we reduce the search space to half the size at every step, until we find the target. Binary Search helps us reduce the search time from linear O(n) to logarithmic **O(log n)**.

## Template 1 - "Classic Binary Search"
### For solving: "locate the index" types of problems
- **Left & Right: usually referring to a range of INDICES**

:heavy_check_mark: :green_book: [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

```
left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

while left <= right:

    mid = (left + right) >> 1
    
    if nums[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1
    elif nums[mid] > target:
        right = mid - 1
    else:
        return mid
        
return -1
```

## Template 2 - "Minimize k, s.t. k is feasible"
### For solving: "find K-th / minimum / maximum" types of problems
- **Left & Right: usually referring to a range of VALUES**

- **When should we consider using this Binary Search Template**: If we can discover some kind of monotonicity, for example, if condition(k) is True then condition(k + 1) is True (or vice versa), then we can consider this approach.

- **A General Template - Minimize k, s.t. condition(k) is True**: mainly needs a variation of three parts
    - Correctly **initialize the boundary variables left and right** to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to **include all possible elements**
    - Decide **return value**. Is it return left or return left - 1? Remember this: after exiting the while loop, **left is the minimal k satisfying the condition function**
    - Design the **condition / feasible function**. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.

```
# Motivation: minimize [mid] such that [mid] satisfies the given conditions (i.e., feasible(mid) is True)

def binary_search(array) -> int:

    def feasible(value) -> bool:
        # TODO - write your implementation to check whether [value] satisfies the given conditions
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # must include the ENTIRE search space
    
    while left < right:
    
        # Note: when an array has an even number of elements
        # it's your decision to use either the left mid (lower mid) or the right mid (upper mid)
        
        # if choosing left/lower mid -> when MINIMIZING (i.e., moving right when feasible)
        mid = (left + right) >> 1 
        
        # if choosing right/upper mid -> when MAXIMIZING (i.e., moving left when feasible)
        mid = (left + right + 1) >> 1
        
        if feasible(mid): # if this is good, we move to the lower portion (PRESERVING mid) to look for smaller options
            right = mid # (for MINIMIZING)
            # OR move to the upper portion to check for larger options: "left = mid" (for MAXIMIZING)
            
        else: # otherwise move to upper portion (EXCLUDING mid) to look for larger options
            left = mid + 1 # (for MINIMIZING)
            # OR move to the lower portion to check for smaller options: "right = mid - 1" (for MAXIMIZING)
            
    return left # left is the minimum (or maximum, depending on your implementation) satisfying the "feasible" condition
```

```
# Basic checking
if not nums:
    return [-1, -1]

# Find first position
left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        right = mid - 1 # go left
    elif nums[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1 # go right
    else:
        right = mid - 1 # go left

# Find last position
left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) >> 1
    if nums[mid] == target:

# Getting first position (MINIMIZING index, s.t. nums[index] >= target, i.e. discard right)
left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

while left < right:
    mid = (left + right) >> 1
    if nums[mid] >= target: # if nums[index] >= target, then automatically nums[index + 1] >= target, discard upper half
        right = mid # go left to find possible smaller solutions
    else:
        left = mid + 1 # go right to find possible solutions

first_pos = left if nums[left] == target else -1

# Getting last position (MAXIMIZING index, s.t. nums[index] <= target, i.e. discard left)

left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

while left < right:
    mid = (left + right + 1) >> 1
    if nums[mid] <= target: # if nums[index] <= target, then automatically nums[index - 1] >= target, discard lower half
        left = mid # go right to find possible larger solutions
    else:
        right = mid - 1 # go left to find possible solutions

last_pos = right if nums[right] == target else -1

return [first_pos, last_pos]
