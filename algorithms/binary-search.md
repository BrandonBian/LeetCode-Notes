## - General Binary Search Ideas (and a Template)
- **Conceptually**: Basically, it splits the search space into two halves and only keep the half that probably has the search target and throw away the other half that would not possibly have the answer. In this manner, we reduce the search space to half the size at every step, until we find the target. Binary Search helps us reduce the search time from linear O(n) to logarithmic **O(log n)**.

- **When should we consider using Binary Search**: If we can discover some kind of monotonicity, for example, if condition(k) is True then condition(k + 1) is True, then we can consider binary search

- **A General Template - Minimize k , s.t. condition(k) is True**: mainly needs a variation of three parts
    - Correctly **initialize the boundary variables left and right** to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to **include all possible elements**
    - Decide **return value**. Is it return left or return left - 1? Remember this: after exiting the while loop, **left is the minimal k satisfying the condition function**
    - Design the **condition / feasible function**. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.

```
def binary_search(array) -> int:

    def feasible(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if feasible(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
            
    return left
```
