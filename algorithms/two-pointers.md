# Two Pointers
* **Note**: 
  * :heavy_check_mark: means **MUST DO (i.e., very important, typical, or good) problems** that should definitely be familiar with
  * :wavy_dash: means problems that are less typical
  * :green_book: means **EASY problems** as defined by LeetCode
  * :orange_book: means **MEDIUM problems** as defined by LeetCode
  * :closed_book: means **HARD problems** as defined by LeetCode
  * The brackets after each LeetCode problem: summarizes **relevant keypoints / algorithms** used in solving that problem

## Relevant Concepts

### - Characteristics of problems that can be solved with Two Pointers:
  - "If a wider scope of the sliding window is valid, the narrower scope of that wider scope is valid" must hold.
  - "If a narrower scope of the sliding window is invalid, the wider scope of that narrower scope is invalid" must hold.

### - Types of Two Pointers: (see problems list below for more examples)
  - **Face-to-Face**: usually for problems of types "reverse, two sum, partition"
  - **Back-to-Back**: usually for problems of types "palindrome substring, find k-closest elements"
  - **Same-Direction**: usually for problems of types "sliding window, fast & slow pointers"

## Typical Examples & Concepts
### "Face-to-Face -> 2 Sum": :heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

```
# Goal: find the location of two elements that sum to target
# two pointers starting from either end of array and going towards the middle

left_ptr, right_ptr = 0, len(numbers) - 1

while left_ptr < right_ptr:

    two_sum = numbers[left_ptr] + numbers[right_ptr]

    if two_sum == target:
        return [left_ptr + 1, right_ptr + 1] # + 1 because the question requires the index to + 1

    elif two_sum < target:
        left_ptr += 1

    else:
        right_ptr -= 1
```

### "Face-to-Face -> Partition": :heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [LintCode 31 · Partition Array](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/31/)

```
# Goal: partition array such that all elements < k are moved to left, >= k moved to right, return partition index

def partition_array(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

    if not nums:
        return 0

    # two pointers starting from either end of array
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:

        # find the numbers that are misplaced on either side
        while left <= right and nums[left] < k: 
            # stop when we found a nums[left] >= k, it is misplaced
            left += 1
        while left <= right and nums[right] >= k: 
            # stop when we found a nums[right] < k, it is misplaced
            right -= 1

        # exchange
        if left <= right:
            nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]

            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return left # index of the first element on the right partition
